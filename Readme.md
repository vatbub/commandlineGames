# commandlineGames
Sometimes, I find myself being bored often looking for some quick and nice games that don't take long. On the other hand, I am a bit of a nerd and like the spirit of the command line. Then again, I am not nerdy enough to use Linux and I found only very few command line games for windows.

That's why I decided one night to start this collection of small mini console games in java and thus compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Currently available mini games
- GuessMyNumber
- QuickMath

More to come...

## Downloads
CI, binaries, downlads, waaiit, give me some time pls and I will offer you all of that. Right now, you need to clone the repo and build your own binary by running `mvn package`. Then, you can run `java -jar commandlineGames-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`from the `target`-folder.

Have fun!
